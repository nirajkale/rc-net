# rc-net
## A use-case for pynetwork for raspberry pi based projects (Roboitics &amp; IOT)

This use case is based on pynetwork package ( https://github.com/nirajkale/pynetwork), which meant to handle your network workloads
by allowing you to stream your data to & from your python subroutines over the network.
For more information on pynetwork, head over to github page, make sure to get some basic info on the same before continuing on this
thread.

## Abstract

With packge like RPi, IO programming on raspberry pi has becomes a breeze as opposed to doing IO programming on hard-core 
microcontrollers like AVR-18 or something. But integrating it with a RC comm protocol has always been a painful part of any
robotics/IOT project. This is my attempt at simplyifying using pynetwork.

## Reasons for using pynetwork:
